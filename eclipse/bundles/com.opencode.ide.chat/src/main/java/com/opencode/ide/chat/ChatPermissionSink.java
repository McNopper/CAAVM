/**
 * Receiver for permission events of chat (non-fleet) opencode sessions:
 * {@code permission.asked} while a session waits for a human decision,
 * {@code permission.replied} once it was answered (by this sink or any other
 * client, e.g. an attached TUI). Registered globally through
 * {@link ChatPermissions#setSink(ChatPermissionSink)}; the chat bundle itself
 * installs none — without a sink, permission events are ignored exactly as
 * before.
 *
 * <p>Called on the SSE background thread: implementations dispatch to the UI
 * thread themselves and must not block. Throwing is contained — an exception
 * never breaks the event loop; the next event is still delivered. With
 * several chat views open the same event reaches the sink once per view:
 * deduplicate by {@link PermissionRequest#permissionId()}. Answer a pending
 * request through the handed client
 * ({@code respondToPermission(sessionId, permissionId, response, remember)}).</p>
